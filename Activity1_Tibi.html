    <h2>My HTML Journey from <mark>Chaos</mark> to <mark>Cat Videos</mark></h2>
    <h3>Or, how I accidentally created a self-playing cat video website (and almost lost my sanity)</h3>
    </body>
<p>
    Armed with boundless <i>enthusiasm</i> and <i>zero coding experience</i>, I embarked on my quest to conquer <mark>HTML</mark><br>
    Little did I know, my journey would be <small>less</small> <b>"Lord of the Rings</b> and more <b>"Three Stooges."</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    My <u>first website,</u> lovingly named <b>"Brenda's Blossoming Boutique"</b> ,resembled a digital <mark>Jackson Pollock </mark>painting.<br>
    Tags were <del>scattered</del> like <i>confetti ,colors clashed</i> like a sunset on <mark>Mars, </mark>and the navigation system could only be <br>
    described as <b>"whimsical"</b> <sub>(by a very generous browser).</sub>
    <br>
    <br>
    Determined to redeem myself, I tackled a <b>"simple"</b> project: <mark>a cat video gallery </mark>. What ensued was a <i>hilarious</i><br>
    <sub>(and slightly terrifying)</sub><u>ballet of misplaced semicolons ,</u> <u>rogue line breaks ,</u> and <u>images</u> that danced uncontrollably<br>
    <del>across</del>the screen. At one point, my entire website transformed into an <i>auto-playing cat video slideshow </i>,much to <br>
    the amusement<sub>(and slight concern)</sub> of my family.
    <br>
    <br>
    After <u>several meltdowns ,</u> <u>countless tutorials ,</u> and g<u>allons of coffee ,</u> I finally managed to wrangle my code into <i>submission.</i><br>
    My cat video gallery wasn't exactly <b>"elegant"</b> , but it functioned <sub>(mostly)</sub> .And hey, at least I learned that even the <mark>clumsiest<br>
    coder </mark>can create something... <i>interesting</i> .So, here's to <mark>Brenda's Blossoming Boutique ,</mark> <mark><i>the self-playing cat video extravaganza ,</i> </mark><br>
    and the <del>never ending </del>quest to master the art of <mark>HTML!</mark>
