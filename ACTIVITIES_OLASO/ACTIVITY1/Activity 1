         <h2> My THML Journey from <mark> to </mark> Cat Vidoes </mark> </h2> </h2> <br>
         <h3> Or, how i accidentally created a self-pacing cat vidoe website (and almost loat my sanity) </h3> <br>
         <p> Armed with boundless <i> enthusiasm </i> and <i>  zero coding experience, </i> I embarked on my quest to conquer <mark> html </mark> <br>
         <p> My <ins> firs website </ins> loving named <b> "Brenda's Blossoming Boutique" <b>, resembled a digital <mark> Jaskson Pollock </mark> paining.<br>
             Little did I know, my journey would be <i> <b>  "Lord of the Rings" </b>, resembled a digital <mark>  "Three Stooges" </b> </p>
           Tag were <del> scatted </del> like <i> confetti, color clashed </i> like a sunset on <mark> Mars .</mark> and the navigation system could only be <br>
           described as <b> "whimsical" </b> <sub> (by a very generous browser)  </sub> <br> </p>
         <p>Determined to rendeem myself, I tackled a <b>  "simple </b> project: <mark> a cat video gallery. </mark> What ensued was a <i> hilarious </i> <br>
            <sup> (and slightly terrifiying) </sup> <ins> ballet of misplacewd semicolons, <ins> rogue line breaks, </ins> and <ins> image </ins> that dances uncontrollably <br>"             <del> across </del> the screen. At one point, my entire website transformed into an <i> auto-playing cat video slideshow, </i> much to <br>
         <p> After <ins> severasl meltdown, </ins> <ins>  countless tutorials, </ins> and gallons of coffee. </ins> I finally managed to wrangle my code into <i>summission. </i> <br>
             My cat video galeery wan't exactly <b>  "elegant" </b> , but it functioned <sup> (mostly) </sup>. And hey, at least I learn that <mark> clumsiest <br>
             coder </mark> can create something... <i> interesting .</i> So here's to <mark> Brenda's Blossoming Bountique </mark> . <mark> <i> the self-playing cat video video extravaganza </i></mark> <br>
             and the <del> never-ending </del> quest to master the art of <mark> <b> HTM! </b></mark> </p>
