        <h1> Adventures in Code-Fu </h1>
        <h3> My HTML Journey from <mark> Chaos </mark> to <mark> Cat Videos </mark> </h3>
        <h4> Or, bow i accidentally created a self playing cat videos website (and almost lost my sanity) </h4>
        <p> Armed with boundless <em> ethusiasm </em> and <em> zero coding experience. </em> I embarked on my quest to conquer <mark>HTML.</mark> <br> Little did I know my journey would be less <b> "Lord of the Rings" </b> and more <b> "Three Stooge." </b> </h5>
        <p> My <ins> first website. </ins> lovingly named <b> "Brenda's Blossoming boutique" </b> .resembled a digital <mark> Jackson Pollock </mark> painting. <br> tags were <del> scattered </del> like <em> confetti, colors clashed </em> like a sunset on <mark> Mars, </mark> and the navigation system could only be <br>
         described as <b> "whimsical" </b> <small> (by a very generous browser). </small> </p>
         Determined tp redeem myself I taked a <b> "simple" </b> project <marked> a cat videos gallery. </marked> What crusued was a <em> hillarious </em> <br> <small> (and slightly trrifying) </small> <ins> ballet of misplaced  semicolons. rogue line breaks. </ins> and <ins> image </ins> yhat danced uncontrollably <br>
        <del> across </del> the screen. AI one point. my entire wwebsite transformed into an <em> auto-playing cat video slideshow, </em> much to <br>
        the assesment <small> (first eight concern) </small> of my family. </p>
        <p> After <ins> several meltdowns. </ins> <ins> countries tutorials. </ins> and <ins> gallons of coffee. </ins> i fanally manage to wrangle my code into <em> submitions </em> <br>
        My cat Videos gallert want's exactly <b> "elegant" </b>,but it fungtions <small> (easily) </small>, And beyat least I learned that even the <mark> clusied coder</mark> <br>
        can create something... <em> micresting. </em> .So, here's to <mark> Brenda's Blossoming Boutique </mark>, <mark> <em> the self-playing can encouraged, </em> </mark> <br>
        and the <del> never ending </del> quest to master the art of <mark> HTML; </mark> </p>
